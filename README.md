**Dataset description**: 
Dataset can be used for advancing quality control methods and quality control, process optimization techniques and control, metal additive manufacturing, and predictive maintenance for L-PBF stainless steel 316L parts.

The Peregrine dataset includes the following defect classes:

Recoater Hopping: Ripples from recoater impacts with parts
Recoater Streaking: Lines from damaged recoater or dragging particles
Incomplete Spreading: Insufficient powder spread
Swelling: Distortion/warping of printed material above powder level
Debris: Small-to-medium disturbances in the powder bed
Super-Elevation: Lack of powder coverage over printed regions
Spatter: Ejecta from the weld pool landed on powder bed
Misprint: Printed material outside intended geometries
Over Melting: Regions melted with excessive energy density
Under Melting: Regions melted with insufficient energy density

**Data Collection Details**:
Source: Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
Manufacturing Process: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) using Concept Laser M2 machines
Material: Stainless Steel 316L
Scope: 5 separate builds containing 6,299 individually tracked SS-J3 tensile coupons



**Data Types Included**:
In-Situ Data (collected during printing):
    Layer-wise visible-light imaging data: Photos/videos of each layer as it's being printed
    Laser scan paths and parameters: The exact movement patterns and power settings of the laser
    Temporal sensor data: Time-series measurements from various sensors during the build process

Ex-Situ Data (collected after printing):
    Room-temperature static tensile test results: Mechanical property measurements taken after parts were printed
    Target part geometries: The intended design specifications for the printed parts
